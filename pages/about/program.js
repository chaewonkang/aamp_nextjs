              <p>
                The current situation of a rise in neo-fascism alongside the
                COVID-19 pandemic is the result of the era of neoliberal
                capitalism. This social atmosphere leads us to refocus on the
                idea of ‘becoming’ in a way that indicates that the epistemology
                of the world is not fixed and determined. Therefore, the status
                quo needs to be re-imagined, challenging us to constantly exist,
                act and think in new ways in response to sudden unexpected
                changes in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                The artistic workshop
                <span class='text-style-2'>Becoming-Local</span>suggests
                epistemological changes to discourses about what the idea of
                “local” means under the centre/periphery model that is
                internalized in our daily lives. Moreover, it is concerned with
                how artists’ practice can respond to these crises and changes in
                a socially distanced society.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class='text-style-3'>Becoming-Local</span>is a ‘Public
                Sphere’ in which the interplay of heterogeneous and hybrid
                elements is revealed in multi-layers around the concept of the
                local. Breaking away from the traditional geographical
                understanding of the concept of 'local', it becomes a place
                where the many different viewpoints and methodologies of
                participating artists cross, collide, and converge. The purpose
                is to enable the local subject to actively participate in the
                process of subjectivisation in a complex and multi-layered
                manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                This practice-led research workshop will examine the possibility
                that participating artists understand it as a process of
                becoming, and change their habitual way of thinking and
                construction of ideas through artistic responses and repetition.
                Moreover, the artists as co-agents affect each other and will
                participate in the workshop by individually witnessing
                performative practice and its process. We expect this workshop
                to constantly reconstruct multiple and diverse performative
                discourse with both the direct and indirect participation of a
                number of artists.

                  Moving away from structural ensemble of universal realities to

                  social entities into topological configuration of province,

                  This workshop has both research and practice components, with
                  a specific focus on the concept of local. The workshop can be
                  cross-examined with reference to a significant range of
                  interdisciplinary arts such as moving image, sound art, and
                  performance art.

                <p>
                  Each artists’ group holds three workshops until the end of
                  November which is practical-led research based on moving
                  image, sound, performance working with its collaboration drawn
                  from a wide range of resources and materials. The record of
                  three workshop is required in any form: text (excerpt is
                  fine), image, sound, etc. These record can be a part of
                  presentation in late November to early December. All
                  participating artists and groups will present their own
                  work-in-progress with attending online interim presentations
                  organized by AAMP in late November to early December. This
                  artist workshop is an ongoing project and the final work will
                  be presented in the first half of 2021. The research works
                  will be published in a book which will also be distributed to
                  international institutions and film festival circuits.

                  1. The configuration of local can be always altered by change.
                  In other words, local is always differentiated by itself.
                  <br /> 2. The study of local describes its effect rather than
                  substance. <br />
                  3. The formation of local already exists in somewhere. Only
                  this is a specific situation, in other words, it means that it
                  is revealed as various aspects by specific place and time,
                  social structure, human intra-action, contact with the
                  outside. <br />
                  4. Local is asymmetrical with global. <br />
                  5. Local can be referred to a real space. At the same time, it
                  is variable or accidental. <br />
                  6. Local is a communal accommodation and logistics warehouse.
                  <br />
                  7. Everything changes intermittently, but always locates in
                  there. <br />
                  8. Everything is accidental.
                  <br /> 9. Something of an object can be more interesting than
                  an action of an object. <br />
                  10. Local is purely immanent, but extrinsic relation can be
                  more interesting to grasp its essence.

                  Through this workshop, we aim for artists to be able to extend
                  their own practice in relation to other artists. We encourage
                  artists to freely communicate and connect with others in this
                  network. Each artist should lead the workshop with their own
                  keywords and propose how to explore ideas, experiences, and
                  methodologies in an experimental way. We look forward to
                  participating in an open forum on how different interests,
                  genres, and media influence each other.

                  universal realities to several points; Becoming is actions and
                  energy in which heterogeneous terms are connected across seas
                  and continents, satellites and 5G.
