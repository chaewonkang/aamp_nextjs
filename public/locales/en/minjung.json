  "ch1_text": "Bunleua’s beginning reads like Joseph Campbell’s The Hero With a Thousand Faces. At a young age, Bunleua ran away from his home in Nong Khai, Thailand. He then fell into a cave and met the hermit, master Keoku, who became his spiritual mentor. Having great reverence for his teacher, Bunleua named his life’s work, Keoku Pavilion, after his master. It is believed that Bunleua was the reincarnation of Naga, who forbade him from becoming a monk, which led him on other spiritual paths. Bunleua later moved to Vientiane, Laos, and became a secular man. In 1958 he started the construction of Buddha Park (also known as Xiong Khuan). He was incarcerated in Vientiane for unspecified reasons and fled back to Nong Khai after the city fell to the Pathet Lao—a communist political movement—in 1975.",
