  "artistInfo": "Sabina Hyoju Ahn is an artist engaging with various media represented through auditory perception, tactile sense, visual elements and a mixture of digital and analog technology. Her research seeks to find hidden rules and patterns in natural elements and multi-layered relationships between human and non-human sentient beings by translating imperceptible data in natural elements into different perceptual experiences. In her work, biological materials are often used, combined or connected to machines, and transformed. Her recent research focuses on the physical nature of the human perceptional system driven by a post-digital media concept and applying a contemporary scientific and artistic research method. Her works have been shown in various places including Piksel Festival (NO), Transmediale Vorspiel (DE), Mediamatic (NL), Athens Digital Arts Festival (GR), AMRO (AT), Lab 30 (DE), Art Center Nabi (KR), ACT Festival (KR), Daechung Chungjoo City Museum of Art (KR), V2 (NL), TADAEX festival (IR), WRO Media Art Biennale (PL) and she has been awarded NIME (New Interface for Musical Expression (2017) Best Sound Performance."
