    "intro2barter0": " Two artists barter objects online during a pandemic. In a span of four months, we see what things they end up with that makes them happy. It’s up to them how many exchanges they make as long as both parties agree. No meet-ups, no buying or selling. just a remote exchange via rider delivery during the lockdown From November to March 2021, they do the exchange through barter groups and social media posts and messages. What things do they exchange for? What do they learn about themselves in the process?",

    "denvicky0": "and I share our predisposition towards rhythm. She and I, I think, understand things about each other because of this. Not only that we both like to keep to ourselves. We tend to pause/think/hesitate a bit to speak so that we absorb more before anything else. I don’t know if she feels this way though but I still think we both have an affinity to ride the waves and keep at things rhythm-wise.",
    "denvicky1": "With this project, I am interested to know more about the timing of her responses while negotiating within herself whether to accept or reject a thing for exchange.",

    "findings1": "When I set out to do the project, I wanted to really get to know more about these artists, who are also my friends, in a roundabout way.",
    "findings2": "By exchanging items, they get to see what things they have and want to give up, what things are of equal value. Do they settle for things they’re not too okay with or do they work hard to get an item they’re happy with?",
    "findings3": "I told them about the children’s book ,",
    "findings4": ", where two hands, clasped together, start off with a proposed exchange. For a butterfly. Throughout the book, a series of exchanges. From the butterfly, the hands acquire valuable things until it ends up with owning the world, the planet, the air. Of course, it’s a book for kids, teaching us about imagination, a progression of ideas, dreams and desires, and so on.",
    "findings5": "Pat Kay talked to her friend, D Jay, about the project. The way they talked about my own instructions tothem made me feel a bit embarrassed. It seemed likeI was setting out to read their mind, their “desiresand dreams”",
    "findings6": "Still, I had a good time “spending moments with them”. At times, I felt I was intruding.",
    "findings7": "Unexpected things I did",
    "findings8": "I did count how long Den waited and gave up on a reply from someone. It was amusing to feel more of her world just by waiting with her for a reply.",

    "patkay": "PAT KAY",
    "patkay0": "Here's a Pat Kay",
    "patkay1": "“This collection is more on my former interests fromhigh school. I used to be really into classic rock like Queen, LedZeppelin, Bob Dylan, that kinda stuff. But I’ve outgrowna lot of it because of the values that the bandshold and the content of their music doesn’t really resonate with me as much anymore. This was a huge part of my identity back then in high school but not anymore!”",
    "patkay2": "Pat Kaymakes me feel old. She was my student yearsback, and she was a brilliant artist even then.Pat Kay, whose character and heart shone unmistakablyin the classroom. Which was, for me, a spacethat I remember filled with students who conform,in uniform, and are pressured to fit in. Pat Kay wasunapologetically Pat Kay. And I wish I was Pat Kaywhen I was in school. But I was a spoiled, shelteredteenager who wanted to play games all the time. Imissed out on a lot of things, and Pat Kay would havebeen a role model for me if we were in school together.",
    "patkay3": "Useful shit",
    "patkay4": "Pat Kay found it hard to exchange her Led Zeppelin album for Mariah Carey merch, which was all shereally wanted. “I don’t know, I don’t want random shit in my house.” She thinks older people don’t use Facebook, whereshe posts her barter items. And in barter groupsthere, she sees that people want useful things. Householditems, grocery, food. And for a time, Pat Kay tried that out.",
    "patkay5": "She said there were specific groups for bartering items. Barter for Music items, CDs, for example. Still,noone wanted her shit, she said.",
    "shady": "SHADY",
    "shady0": "Shady Meet-ups",
    "shady1": "Against my instructions, Pat Kay did meet-ups insteadof deliveries via riders to do the negotiation andexchange. She said they wanted to save on shippingfee, especially if they both lived close to eachother.“I also don’t want to get scammed.”",
    "shady2": "To which, Den added that sometimes things are already too digital that you crave for human presence.",
    "shady3": "Pat Kay recalled dealing with onetito, slang foruncle, who wanted to meet up for the Beatles CD barter.He sent her a selfie wearing a Pink Floyd shirt, andshe didn’t know why. She went in on the details,herhaving to lie about her age, him telling her he’sgoing to the cemetery to visit family.",
    "shady4": "I had to soft scold Pat Kay. The man proposed to meether at her place because she was nearby.Thankfully, nothing happened.",

    "shady6": "“Where’s Pink Floyd?” “It’s there.” “Okay, check it.” “It’s good.” (inaudible) “Okay? Take care. Happy weekend.” Siren of a police car passing by. “Thank God, it was such a short interaction. I thoughthe was still gonna try andtalk to me.”",
    "shady7": "Riders",
    "shady8": "For much of the pandemic, we could sometimes onlyhear motorcycles passing by. During the strictlockdowns, no one was allowed to roam except for ridersdelivering goods to households.",
    "shady9": "Here, Den exchanges the bird for a turtle via Grab,a logistics carrier.",
    "waiting": "WAITING",
    "waiting0": "Waiting",
    "waiting1": "While waiting for her next exchange, for the turtlethis time, Den turned to her space and found thingstodo. Not only did the space change (nesting?), shehad quite a transformation, Den. Den was always veryshy to document herself in front of the camera, soto do this was quite a surprise.",
    "waiting2": "Better Place",
    "waiting3": "In doing the exchange, Den really just wanted to helpthe object find a better place. According to her,shewanted the person to treasure it. In giving the firstobject she bartered, the bird, to Kat, an artistsheknows, she wanted to sense that the bird found a goodhome.",
    "waiting4": "She is still in touch with Kat, and she still wants to, in a way, still, look out for the bird she let go. Shechecks her IG to see how the bird is doing. She, too,posts things about the turtle, which is the barteritem she got from Kat, who got it from a past relationship.",
    "waiting5": "Den looked up the spiritual symbolism of the turtleonline and found this: a turtle is something you “carry true home with you”. She had told Kat thatshe wished for her “to see new places, for new thingsto come to her”.",
    "waiting6": "As I wrote, I see myself in Den. How she senses theinvisible narratives and storylines of objects. Istilloften rely a lot on sign posts and other text, numbersthat surround me to guide me through decisionsand paths in life. Like Den, I see myself facilitatingexchanges to continue these felt stories around me.",
    "waiting7": "I asked Den, “Do you think you’re a halfway housefor objects to find their better place?” “Yes.”",

    "badvibes": "BADVIBES",
    "badvibes0": "Bad Energy",
    "badvibes1": "Pat Kay thinks of the bad energy during an exchange. When asked, she didn’t want to give away her Ifugaowooden carvings. These are indigenous woodcarvings, stylized representations of people guardingrice crops in the Northern Philippines, thought tocarry ancestral spirits. Although people might wantthe item, Pat Kay didn’t want to do any harm bypassing on the bad energy to them. So she threw thecarvings away.",
    "badvibes2": "Knowing yourself through rejections",
    "badvibes3": "“(The item you barter) It reflects your personality,right?” “I didn’t realize my personality is hard to market.”",
    "badvibes4": "Pat Kay and D Jay laugh.“What do people want?” “A mirror.” “Okay, I have to find more basic shit.” Pat Kay thinks she doesn’t know how to market her items, and her personality. But, it’s okay, she believesshe will get to know more of herself in the process,just the same --“I’ll find out through rejections.”",
    "badvibes5": "Getting rid of former identity",
    "badvibes6": "D Jay asks her if she’s merely bartering useless thingsto get something valuable in return. Pat Kay says it’s weird for her to be getting itemsthat her “former identity” consumes. She just wantstoget something new, something her present self likes. “Den was telling me about her exchanges, and I don’tknow, but her exchanges areso poetic, versus mine. (laughs)... But it’s okay. Ithink the comparison can showthat I’m trash, and she’s an artist.”",
    "badvibes7": "No local interest",
    "badvibes8": "Den was a bit sad that no one wanted to barter fora work she did, a print. She felt there was no interestin her projects locally. Which is probably why, shethought, no one wanted it.",
    "badvibes9": "She realized later on, talking to someone, that peoplemight have had interest in her work but justcouldn’t find a thing of equal value to it. I think she felt a bit better since then.",

It is asource of corruption. Jueteng has caused the downfallof many politicians. Former President JosephEstrada got in trouble because of it; he was forcedout of office. It was big news during “my time”,and Iwrite this only because I saw D Jay and Pat Kay talkingaboutjuetengto themselves, and it was amusingthat they had to Google it. This was the talk of thenation then.",

Jas hadaturtle from her own childhood that her mother gaveaway without her permission. And which she neversaw again. When she saw the turtle from Den’s feed,she wanted to barter with her.",
    "narratives4": "In doing the exchange, Jas and Den agreed to document things for me, including the path-to-home ofobjects. Interestingly, the package that came fromBerlin was a collection of goodies to send to herfriends and family in the Philippines..",
    "narratives5": "Den was getting a rock from the Dead Sea. But because international shipping is expensive, Jas thoughtof sending a box to fill to accompany the rock, away to maximize shipping fee so more people benefit.",
    "narratives6": "This term “pasabuy”, a word play on “passing on” and“buy” -- groups of people send items they buyoverseas to a single address, to be packed and consolidatedin a single box, for them to split shippingfees. It is anotherbalikbayanbox, a box full ofsouvenirs orpasalubongto families in the Philippines.Overseas Filipino workers come home carrying thesebig cargo boxes all the time.",
